## About LMLM

``LMLM — Local Multi-Language AI Model``
LMLM is your all-in-one, local AI toolkit for coding across multiple languages. Generate, analyze, and automate code directly on your machine — no cloud required. Fast, modular, and designed for developers who want AI to work **with them**, not somewhere else. From Python to Swift, LMLM handles it all. Build smarter, test faster, and stay fully in control.  

**GitHub Tagline (About field)** LMLM — Your local, `multi-language AI` toolkit for `coding, analysis, and automation`.

---

## Features

- **```Multi-language support```:** Python, JavaScript, Swift, Java, C++, and more.  
- **Local execution:** Run models and scripts entirely on your machine.  
- **AI-assisted development:** Auto-generate code, analyze scripts, scaffold projects.  
- **CLI-first:** Command-line interface for fast workflow integration.  
- **Modular & extendable:** Add your own tools, scripts, and AI models easily.  
```python
import os
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient(
    provider="wavespeed",
    api_key=os.environ["HF_TOKEN"],
)

# output is a PIL.Image object
image = client.text_to_image(
    "A fantasy forest with glowing mushrooms",
    model="black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev",
)
```
---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Web4application/lmlm.git
cd lmlm
# Optional: setup virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
gem install ollama-rb

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
⸻

```CLI Usage```

```bash
# Run the main AI workflow
lmlm run

# Initialize a new multi-language project
lmlm init my_project

# Generate code from a prompt
lmlm prompt "Create a Python function to reverse a string"

# Analyze existing scripts
lmlm analyze ./my_project
``

> Hello!

Below you can find a outline of how to reproduce my solution for the <Competition Name> competition.
If you run into any trouble with the setup/code or have any questions please contact me at <email>

> #ARCHIVE CONTENTS
kaggle_model.tgz          : original kaggle model upload - contains original code, additional training examples, corrected labels, etc
comp_etc                     : contains ancillary information for prediction - clustering of training/test examples
comp_mdl                     : model binaries used in generating solution
comp_preds                   : model predictions
train_code                  : code to rebuild models from scratch
predict_code                : code to generate predictions from model binaries

#HARDWARE: (The following specs were used to create the original solution)
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (512 GB boot disk)
n1-standard-16 (16 vCPUs, 60 GB memory)
1 x NVIDIA Tesla P100

#SOFTWARE (python packages are detailed separately in `requirements.txt`):
Python 3.5.1
CUDA 8.0
cuddn 7.1.4.18
nvidia drivers v.384
-- Equivalent Dockerfile for the GPU installs: https://gitlab.com/nvidia/cuda/blob/ubuntu16.04/8.0/runtime/cudnn7/Dockerfile

#DATA SETUP (assumes the [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) is installed)
# below are the shell commands used in each step, as run from the top level directory
mkdir -p data/stage1/
cd data/stage1/
kaggle competitions download -c <competition name> -f train.csv
kaggle competitions download -c <competition name> -f test_stage_1.csv
```bash
mkdir -p data/stage2/
cd ../data/stage1/
kaggle competitions download -c <competition name> -f test_stage_2.csv
cd ..

#DATA PROCESSING
# The train/predict code will also call this script if it has not already been run on the relevant data.
python ./train_code/prepare_data.py --data_dir=data/stage1/ --output_dir=data/stage1_cleaned

#MODEL BUILD: There are three options to produce the solution.
1) very fast prediction
    a) runs in a few minutes
    b) uses precomputed neural network predictions
2) ordinary prediction
    a) expect this to run for 1-2 days
    b) uses binary model files
3) retrain models
    a) expect this to run about a week
    b) trains all models from scratch
    c) follow this with (2) to produce entire solution from scratch

shell command to run each build is below
#1) very fast prediction (overwrites comp_preds/sub1.csv and comp_preds/sub2.csv)
python ./predict_code/calibrate_model.py

#2) ordinary prediction (overwrites predictions in comp_preds directory)
sh ./predict_code/predict_models.sh

#3) retrain models (overwrites models in comp_model directory)
sh ./train_code/train_models.sh
```
